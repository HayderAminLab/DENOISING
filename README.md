# **DENOISING: Dynamic Enhancement and Noise Overcoming in Multimodal Neural Observations via High-density CMOS-based Biosensors**


 A computational framework designed to enhance the fidelity and clarity of large-scale bioelectrical signals by dynamically mitigating noise. It addresses the challenge of 
 pervasive noise in neural recordings from high-density microelectrode arrays, offering an adaptable solution for various noise types and signal dimensions. By improving the signal-to-noise ratio 
 and facilitating the separation of signal and noise components, DENOISING aids in the accurate analysis and interpretation 
 of complex neural connectivity and dynamics without relying on specific data transformations.
